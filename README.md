# Bangalore-house-price-dataset-ML-model-
Trained ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) on Bangalore housing data using scikit-learn, achieving 84.5% accuracy. Used pandas for preprocessing, visualized with seaborn, and deployed the best model via Flask after serialization using pickle

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Model
This project applies multiple regression models to predict housing prices in Bangalore.

âœ… Models Used
Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

ðŸ§ª Preprocessing & Evaluation
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized features, used one-hot encoding for categorical data.

Metrics: RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

ðŸ“ˆ Best Model Performance
Random Forest Regressor

Accuracy: 84.5% (RÂ² Score)

ðŸ’¾ Deployment
Serialized the model using Pythonâ€™s pickle library

Integrated into a Flask backend for real-time predictions
